Implementation Tips:

Exact caching: Use MD5 hash of query as cache key
Semantic caching: Compute embeddings, find nearest neighbors with cosine similarity > 0.95
Storage: In-memory (dict/Redis) or persistent (SQLite/Postgres)
Eviction: Remove least recently used entries when cache exceeds size limit
Cost calculation: savings = (total_tokens - cached_tokens) * model_cost / 1M
