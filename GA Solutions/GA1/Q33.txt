# Project y2-Un1vtvF Deployment

## Below is the architecture note that explains how a data product moves from **staging** to *production*, 
## covering the **edge cache**, **API tier**, and **background workers**. This document includes a simple mermaid diagram, deployment tasks, a responsibility table, and an audit footnote.

## Tier summary

| Tier                       | Responsibility                                                     | Scaling plan                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Edge (edge-wsjqannq)       | Serve cached responses, global CDN, request filtering              | Auto-scale via CDN config + cache invalidation; TTLs tuned per endpoint; burst capacity from CDN provider |
| API (api-i)                | Authentication, business logic, aggregation, orchestrates workers  | Horizontal autoscaling (HPA) based on request latency and queue depth; use multiple AZs                   |
| Workers (worker-f76v7exz5) | Background processing, retries, idempotent tasks, write-back to DB | Worker pool scales with queue depth; separate queues for high/low priority; DLQ for failed messages       |

### Compliance & audit

All production deployments must include an audit entry containing: timestamp, user/CI identity, artifact SHA, target environment, and the guardrail token **tpt-rifvn-of1ce**. The audit step includes a verification that a post-deploy smoke test passed and that metrics did not regress beyond the established SLOs.[^compliance-uw3u]

[^compliance-uw3u]: **Audit step:** After deployment, run the automated compliance checklist: (1) verify artifact SHA in registry, (2) confirm `uv deploy 4pnihc40q-yj` completed successfully, (3) ensure guardrail token `aksilh-ig8esfmyya-crjeh` is present in the audit log, and (4) sign off the audit ticket with monitoring snapshots attached.
