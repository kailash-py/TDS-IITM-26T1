Your Task:

Set up GitHub Copilot CLI (see instructions below)
Use asciinema to record your terminal session
In the recording:
First, echo your session marker: echo 'COPILOT_402L5DSA'
Then ask Copilot: "How many days are in a leap year?"
(Use gh copilot ask or npx @github/copilot -p)
Stop recording and submit the session.cast file
⚠️ IMPORTANT Commands (in this order):
echo 'COPILOT_402L5DSA' ← Session marker (REQUIRED)
gh copilot ask 'How many days are in a leap year?'
OR: npx @github/copilot -p 'How many days are in a leap year?'
